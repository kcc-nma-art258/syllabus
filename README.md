Course Information
ART 258 Interface Programming II (3 credits)
6 hours lecture/lab per week

Prerequisites
ART 128 with a grade of “C” or higher; approval of the Interface Programming II portfolio review or acceptance into a NMA AS specialization.

Course Description
ART 258 Interface Programming II builds upon the foundation level HTML, CSS, and Javascript concepts introduced in ART 128 Interface Programming I. Through lessons, demonstrations, and hands-on-exercise, this course aims to develop intermediate skills in contemporary interface programming practices. Weekly topics will address emerging and popular interface programming techniques and technologies.

Course assignments and grading policy may change at any time. This is a structure I hope to follow throughout the semester.

Course Objectives
Upon successful completion of ART 258, the student should be able to:
Apply intermediate level and advanced concepts and principles of interface programming in the creation of interactive interfaces and applications.
Utilize emerging and contemporary markup, styling, and scripting technologies to create effective interactive client-based interfaces.
Apply knowledge of the theory, history, and principles of interface design in the creation of new media art.
Apply successful problem-solving skills utilizing industry standard applications, vocabulary, technologies, and techniques in the creative and technical production process.
Communicate effectively, both visually and verbally, by presenting work, defending design decisions, and by participating as an active credit during group critiques.
Synthesize the concepts and principles of interface programming with emergent technologies in the creation of interactive interfaces that integrate conceptual thinking, technical execution, and aesthetic application.
Demonstrate professional communication within a team by working together to achieve solutions that best fit a magnitude of problems

Texts
There are no required texts for this course. Readings will be supplied by the instructor and/or student(s) on a week to week basis, in either paper handout form or online.

Materials
The primary software packages used in this class are Adobe Photoshop and Dreamweaver, which will be installed on all computers in class and in the labs. Students are welcome to other types of software such as Adobe Fireworks, Sublime (not provided) or Textmate (not provided).

All students are required to have hosting space to post their designs, assignments, and ultimately their final website.

In addition to producing digital designs, students will be required to submit sketches on paper. While it is not required, it is recommended that you purchase a cheap sketchbook and a set of black and/or grayscale markers.

Additional materials may include backup media (such as external hard drives, blank CD/DVD’s, or a USB flash drive), an online file storage solution (DropBox, GitHub, etc.) and printer paper.

Method of Instruction
The method of instruction will include lectures, studio demonstrations, project development, individual instruction, group discussions, and critiques. Examples are presented when important to describe course content. Class projects and procedures are the focus of many course discussions.

Method of Evaluation
A. PROJECT ASSIGNMENTS								80%
Clarity of Conceptual Understanding							40%
Students will demonstrate their conceptual understanding of project assignments by creating preliminary sketches and drawings and by meeting each projects technical specifications. Students may also be asked to show their understanding by submitting clearly written, well-conceptualized statements, and by showing strong group communication skills during critiques.

Quality of Execution of Assignments							40%
Each student will be expected to create resources (sketches, creative briefs, coded interfaces, digital designs, etc.) based on project guidelines. Additionally, they will complete tutorials and projects that demonstrate their ability to execute specific software and coding techniques. The quality of these techniques and materials will be assessed in the final grade evaluation based on the successful application of the technology in working interactive models.

B. PARTICIPATION/ATTENDANCE							20%
Students will be expected to participate as active class members. This includes attending classes; meeting all project deadlines; completing production time outside of class in the lab environment; and participating as dependable team members. During critiques, students are expected to participate as both presenters and active critics.

Instructor’s Expectations & Student Responsibilities
Lectures, demonstrations and general class participation are an important aspect of this course. For all instructional activities, students are responsible for meeting all of the instructor’s attendance and assignment requirements. Failure to do so may affect their final grade. For unexcused absences, students need to make arrangements with other class members regarding information. Since this is a college course, time outside of class will need to be consistently spent on projects to meet the requirements of the class.

In all college-related activities, including instruction, students must abide by the college’s codes and regulations, refraining from behavior that interferes with the rights and safety of others in the learning environment. If students file a grievance, they are fully responsible for providing proof they have been wronged.

Please have your cell phone on silent during class and provide your own headphones if you will be listening to music so you do not distract others.

Instructor’s Absence
In the event of the instructor’s absence, college policy requires students to wait 15 minutes before leaving.

Attendance
Each student is responsible for the material presented in class, therefore regular attendance is expected. In order to keep up with all lessons and the general pace of the class it is essential that you arriving promptly and remain for the scheduled class period. Leaving class early without permission will result in an absence marked for that class period. Three tardies will equal one unexcused absence. Consistent lateness and absences may result in a lower grade for the semester due to any missed opportunities for graded class participation sessions during class critiques. If you are absent for medical reasons, please provide a note from your doctor or nurse. If there is a severe family problem, a long-term personal illness, or something else that may interfere with the course, please discuss this with me as early as possible. So long as I know about any potential problems in advance, there is usually a solution. Please do not wait until it is too late so as to avoid any repercussions to your grade.

Grading Policy
Grading is based on assignments, projects, and class participation during critiques. It is the responsibility of the student to collect handouts, take notes, complete and turn in assignments on due dates. Make-up assignments will be administered only in cases where there is a valid medical reason accompanied by a doctor’s note. The assigned projects must be turned in on the due date. Missing a deadline will result in a full letter grade reduction for that project unless there is a valid medical reason or a family emergency. Projects may be revised and turned in again for re-grading. Class participation will be considered in the evaluation of the final grade. Disruptive or argumentative behavior will result in a lower grade during final grade evaluation or dismissal from class.

Note: Any student missing the final semester critique or not turning in a final project without prior permission will have a full letter grade taken off the final semester grade.

Student Conduct Code
A college campus is a community with specific behavior expectations designed to allow all students, faculty, and staff to flourish. Please familiarize yourself with KCC’s Student Conduct Code in the course catalog. You should know your rights and responsibilities on campus. The Student Conduct Code describes specific campus policies related to: drug and alcohol use, smoking, lethal weapons, sexual harassment and sexual assault, academic honesty, nondiscrimination, and family privacy.

In all campus environments, Disruptive Behavior will not be tolerated. This means: any speech or action that (1) is disrespectful, offensive, and/or threatening; (2) interferes with the learning activities of other students; (3) impedes the delivery of college services; and/or (4) has a negative impact in any learning environment.

The instructor reserves the right to ask a student to leave the classroom at any point if a student exhibits behavior that is not in accordance with the KCC Student Conduct Code.
