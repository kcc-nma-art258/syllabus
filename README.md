## Texts
There are no required texts for this course. Readings will be supplied by the instructor and/or student(s) on a week to week basis online.

## Materials
The primary software packages used in this class are [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Prepros](https://prepros.io/), and [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), which will be installed on all computers in the KOA 103 class room. All of the listed development software is either free or provides a free trial with no time limit, so students working on personal computers can follow along without purchasing anything.

Students will be required to use design software as part of assignments, so use of Adobe design products (Photoshop/Illustrator/Fireworks) is expected. Adobe Creative Cloud will be installed on all computers in the KOA 103 class room.

Students are also welcome to use other types of design and development software (not provided) such as [Bohemian Coding Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) ($99), [Google Web Designer](https://www.google.com/webdesigner/) (free), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) (free), or [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) ($70).

All students are required to register for a [free Github account](https://github.com/join) to host their assignments, mid-term, and final website. Students are also recommended to sign-up for a [free Codepen account](https://codepen.io/signup/free), as certain class exercises and examples will be showcased using this tool.

While not required, it is recommended that you purchase a cheap sketchbook and a set of black and/or grayscale pencils/pens/markers for initial sketching and ideation.

Additionally, backup media (such as external hard drives or a USB flash drive) or an online file storage solution (Google Drive or DropBox) is recommended.

## Method of Instruction
The method of instruction will include lectures, studio demonstrations, project development, individual instruction, group discussions, and critiques. Examples are presented when important to describe course content. Class projects and procedures are the focus of many course discussions.

## Method of Evaluation

While the content of this course will be focused on front-end web development, assignments and projects will be evaluated based on their visual presentation as well as their functionality.

Students will be expected to create usable interfaces based on user-centered design techniques presented in this course, as well as creative branding and visual designs using the foundational principles taught in the pre-requisite courses for the New Media Arts—Interface Design specialization.

### A. Project Assignments: 80%
#### Clarity of Conceptual Understanding:							40%
Students will demonstrate their conceptual understanding of project assignments by creating preliminary sketches and drawings and by meeting each projects technical specifications. Students may also be asked to show their understanding by submitting clearly written, well-conceptualized statements, and by showing strong group communication skills during critiques.

#### Quality of Execution of Assignments: 40%
Each student will be expected to create resources (sketches, creative briefs, coded interfaces, digital designs, etc.) based on project guidelines. Additionally, they will complete tutorials and projects that demonstrate their ability to execute specific software and coding techniques. The quality of these techniques and materials will be assessed in the final grade evaluation based on the successful application of the technology in working interactive models.

### B. Participation & Attendance: 20%
Students will be expected to participate as active class members. This includes attending classes; meeting all project deadlines; completing production time outside of class in the lab environment; and participating as dependable team members. During critiques, students are expected to participate as both presenters and active critics.

## Instructor’s Expectations & Student Responsibilities
Lectures, demonstrations and general class participation are an important aspect of this course. For all instructional activities, students are responsible for meeting all of the instructor’s attendance and assignment requirements. Failure to do so may affect their final grade. For unexcused absences, students need to make arrangements with other class members regarding information. Since this is a college course, time outside of class will need to be consistently spent on projects to meet the requirements of the class.

In all college-related activities, including instruction, students must abide by the college’s codes and regulations, refraining from behavior that interferes with the rights and safety of others in the learning environment. If students file a grievance, they are fully responsible for providing proof they have been wronged.

Please have your cell phone on silent during class and provide your own headphones if you will be listening to music so you do not distract others.

## Instructor’s Absence
In the event of the instructor’s absence, college policy requires students to wait 15 minutes before leaving.

## Attendance
Each student is responsible for the material presented in class, therefore regular attendance is expected. In order to keep up with all lessons and the general pace of the class it is essential that you arriving promptly and remain for the scheduled class period. Leaving class early without permission will result in an absence marked for that class period. Three tardies will equal one unexcused absence. Consistent lateness and absences may result in a lower grade for the semester due to any missed opportunities for graded class participation sessions during class critiques. If you are absent for medical reasons, please provide a note from your doctor or nurse. If there is a severe family problem, a long-term personal illness, or something else that may interfere with the course, please discuss this with me as early as possible. So long as I know about any potential problems in advance, there is usually a solution. Please do not wait until it is too late so as to avoid any repercussions to your grade.

## Grading Policy
Grading is based on assignments, projects, and class participation during critiques. It is the responsibility of the student to collect handouts, take notes, complete and turn in assignments on due dates. Make-up assignments will be administered only in cases where there is a valid medical reason accompanied by a doctor’s note. The assigned projects must be turned in on the due date. Missing a deadline will result in a full letter grade reduction for that project unless there is a valid medical reason or a family emergency. Projects may be revised and turned in again for re-grading. Class participation will be considered in the evaluation of the final grade. Disruptive or argumentative behavior will result in a lower grade during final grade evaluation or dismissal from class.

Note: Any student missing the final semester critique or not turning in a final project without prior permission will have a full letter grade taken off the final semester grade.

## Student Conduct Code
A college campus is a community with specific behavior expectations designed to allow all students, faculty, and staff to flourish. Please familiarize yourself with KCC’s Student Conduct Code in the course catalog. You should know your rights and responsibilities on campus. The Student Conduct Code describes specific campus policies related to: drug and alcohol use, smoking, lethal weapons, sexual harassment and sexual assault, academic honesty, nondiscrimination, and family privacy.

In all campus environments, Disruptive Behavior will not be tolerated. This means: any speech or action that **(1)** is disrespectful, offensive, and/or threatening; **(2)** interferes with the learning activities of other students; **(3)** impedes the delivery of college services; and/or **(4)** has a negative impact in any learning environment.

The instructor reserves the right to ask a student to leave the classroom at any point if a student exhibits behavior that is not in accordance with the KCC Student Conduct Code.

## This Class is a “Safe Zone”
Discriminatory or rude comments of any kind, particularly regarding gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or religion, will not be tolerated.
